SSL and RSI Combined Trading Strategy with Bayesian Optimization

This project implements a trading strategy combining the SSL Semaphore Signal and RSI indicators. Using Bayesian optimization, we fine-tune the best periods and thresholds for these indicators to maximize performance metrics such as the Sharpe Ratio, Cumulative Return, and Maximum Drawdown.

Current Features:

SSL and RSI-based strategy with customizable periods and thresholds
Bayesian optimization for finding the best parameter values
Backtesting on historical data using Backtrader
Performance metrics: Sharpe Ratio, Cumulative Return, Maximum Drawdown
Next Steps:

Implement risk management (take profit, stop loss)
Introduce volatility handling to adapt the strategy to varying market conditions
Expand to a multi-asset portfolio for better diversification
Optimize compute efficiency as the strategy scales
